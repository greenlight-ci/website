## Easy and fast setup

```bash
$ curl -L https://github.com/greenlight/cli/archive/master.tar.gz | tar xvz
cd greenlight-* && sudo make install

# start running audits
$ greenlight
```

## Clean and simple reports

Reports are generated in `text`, `html`, and `json` allowing you to further customize by creating your own custom dashboards.

<div class="demo" id="demo"></div>

<script>
export default {
  mounted () {
    const demo = document.querySelector('#demo')
    let script = document.createElement('script')
    script.async = true
    script.dataset.size = 'small'
    script.dataset.cols = 150
    script.dataset.rows = 28
    script.id = "asciicast-Zy8rKRIfWqzbDiCZGLD86YIsW"
    script.src = 'https://asciinema.org/a/Zy8rKRIfWqzbDiCZGLD86YIsW.js'
    demo.appendChild(script)
  }
}
</script>

> _output from `audits/demo` plugin, which as you can tell, is totally meaningless mumbo jump, checkout some [real plugins](/plugins/) instead_
