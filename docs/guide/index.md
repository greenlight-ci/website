# Introduction

Maintaining quality is hard, maintaining quality across a matrix of projects, teams, and technology stacks is even harder.

We have many tools and libraries at our disposal that can be used to keep our fingers on the pulse of a project's technical health, from inception to sunset. However these tools do not share any commonality in either format nor operation.

## What is Greenlight

The purpose of Greenlight, is to act as The Modern Platform for Auditing, weaving a common operating model and data format between any existing tool, and be the framework for building new auditing & quality checks with minimal effort.

## Features

- **Language Agnostic**  
  Greenlight uses Docker Engine under the hood to allow for scalable operations and language agnostic plugin creation.

- **Plugin Powered**  
  Choose your own adventure by using [official](/plugins/) and [community plugins](/plugins/community.html), as well as your own [custom private plugins](/plugins/custom.html).

- **High Performance**  
  Scales to support large teams and projects on your own infrastructure or in the cloud, leveraging Docker Swarm to run and scale audits in parallel.

- **Runs Anywhere**  
  Run locally as part of your TDD, throw into Git hooks to catch mistakes before you commit, or run as part of your CI/CD pipeline for ultimate gating of team mistakes.

- **Centralized Reports**  
  _(coming soon)_ Track issues and trends over time and share with your team through a simple and easy to use Dashboard.

- **GitHub App**  
  _(coming soon)_ Remove the guessing work from reviewing Pull Requests, provide a helpful and detailed change requests for contributors.

## How it Works

Greenlight is distributed as a binary or a Docker image, which in turn orchestrates running any number of Docker images _(referred to as "plugins" in this context)_ against your Project.

Each plugin is a Docker image that expects a pre-defined execution pattern, and produces a stream of Issues that gets aggregated into Reports with simple actionable view to tackle found issues.

Greenlight and Plugins are configured through a `greenlight.yml` file in your project's root.

### TL;DR

#### Your Project:

```plain
project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ module.js
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ module.spec.js
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ foo.js
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .eslintrc
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .greenlight.yml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.js
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
```

#### `.greenlight.yml`

```yaml
version: 1.0.0

plugins:
  audits/eslint:
    exclude: node_modules/**
    include:
      - src
      - test
    options:
      fix: true
```

if your `foo.js` contains any broken ESLint rules, then Greenlight will output the following:

```plain
‚óè audits/eslint found 1 issues

‚óè audits/eslint issues: 1

src/foo.js

1:7  major  'my-var' is assigned a value but never used.  no-unused-vars
```

## Why Not ...?

### CodeClimate

[CodeClimate](https://codeclimate.com/) is actually one of the main insperation sources for Greenlight, ever since they [Open Sourced](https://codeclimate.com/blog/code-climate-platform/) their platform has been inspiring me with more ideas of what can be done with this model they initiatied. However, it seems the open source platform promise did not live up to the PR hype, and it seems the company is more interested in new initatives than evolving and supporting the platform. The main limitation there is that all "engines" _(equivilant to Greenlight plugins)_ have to be hand-approved by company representatives before they can be used, furthermore, aside from the CLI Engine, nothing else is actually open source, including their server technology and dashboards.

Greenlight in contrast is **100% open source**, Client, Server, Dashboards and Plugins. **Forever.**

### Danger JS

[Danger](https://danger.systems/) is yet another source of inspiration for Greenlight, the deep integration into CI/CD pipeline, tight integration with Github, and easily customizable rules is a thing of beauty. 

Danger has a highly opinionated DSL needed for writing rules, It is also [_mostly_](https://danger.systems/js/usage/danger-process.html) JavaScript oriented. More importantly, Danger seems to be mainly focused on being triggered during an application change state, Greenlight in contrast, is not opinionated on state / lifecylce, and can be triggered before, during, or after a commit, PR, etc ...

Greenlight is also langauge agnostic, and does not enforce any DSL, and thanks to Docker it is able to execute plugins across different languages in parallel, so long as they produce [spec compliant](/plugins/custom.html) ouput through the container `stdout`.

I would also point out Danger's excellent call-out to the [Cultural Impact](http://danger.systems/js/usage/culture.html) and how to address it with your team! üëå

### Codebeat / Codacy / Side CI / etc ...

Many "Code Quality" Services are nothing but wrappers around open source libraries, (which is totally fine) and they provide added value by creating dashboards and tracking trends with your team, Here again, Greenlight takes inspiration and provides a scalable alternative that is 100% open source and free.

Greenlight goes above and beyond by allowing you to create your own [custom audits](/plugins/custom.html) as well as providing the concept of [Extensions](/extensions/) which allows you to expand beyond simple code scanning, and infinitly extend the scope of Greenlight.
